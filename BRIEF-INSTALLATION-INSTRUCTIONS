JPC-RR quick installation instructions:

1) Ensure you have JDK6 installed, if not, install it (no, JRE or JDK5 is
not sufficient)

2) Compile the source. './build.sh' (Unix) or 'build' (windows).

3) Get BIOS/DOS disk images. Original JPC source code
(http://www-jpc.physics.ox.ac.uk/download_download.html) is good place
to rip those from. They are files bios.bin, vgabios.bin and floppy.img.

4) Change directory to top of source tree and make directory named
'library' (or something like that).

5) Convert the images:

'java ImageMaker --BIOS library/BIOS <path-to-bios.bin>'
'java ImageMaker --BIOS library/VGABIOS <path-to-vgabios.bin>'
'java ImageMaker --floppy1440 library/FreeDOS <path-to-floppy.img>'

Note that BIOS should be named 'BIOS' and vgabios should be named
'VGABIOS' as those are the defaults for main system BIOS / VGA BIOS.

If the floppy image is not for 1.44MB floppy, that --floppy1440 option
may need adjusting (e.g. use --floppy2880 for 2.88MB images).

6) Grab game files and make images out of these:

'java ImageMaker --HDD=16,63,16 library/somegame <directory-of-game-files>'

I use 16,63,16 if game fits into that (it provodes ~8MB space). If it
doesn't then 128,63,16 (~64MB) or even 1023,63,16 (~512MB).

The emulator should now be set up.

7) Launch the emulator

'java JPCApplication -library library -autoexec assemble.bat'

Autoexec.bat contains reasonable set of initialization commands.

If you run emulator from directory other than the source tree, then:

-Set CLASSPATH to '<directory-jpcrr-source-is>:.' (Unix) or
'<directory-jpcrr-source-is>;.' (Windows)
- Replace 'library' with path to library directory.
- Replace 'assemble.bat' with path to corresponding file.

Hints:

- DOSIDLE interferes with emulator. Either skip autoexec.bat coming
on FreeDOS that comes with JPC or confirm line by line and leave
that out.
- Putting the HD as HDD (4th hard drive) avoids BIOS having to timeout
HDD, speeding up boot.
